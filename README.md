# Data Analysis

**Author**: Stephen Koch
**Version**: 1.0.0

## Overview
This file is for analyzing data using two different Jupyter Notebooks. We are using NumPy and Pandas to access and work with data from [video game sales](https://www.kaggle.com/gregorut/videogamesales) and [cycling](https://www.kaggle.com/pronto/cycle-share-dataset).

## Getting Started

First, make sure that you have python3 installed:
```
$ python3 --version
Python 3.7.5
```
If you do not:
```
$ brew install python
```
You need to have the files locally. Click on the green clone or download button and Download ZIP:

In your command line, navigate to this directory:
```
$ cd ~  ##this is your root directory
$ cd Downloads  ##by default: Downloads is a directory inside of your root; and where your file will be downloaded
$ cd pythonic-garage-band ##and now you are in this directory
```
This is a command line interface game.
To start the game:
```
$ python3 game_of_greed.py
```
Follow the prompts - Good luck!
